# Assignment 

The customer requires to develop a system to control the workflow between two departments. The
main reason for this decision from the customerâ€™s side was ineffective documentation of the processes
among employees of the departments. As a result, the management was forced to hire a specialist
to document all data transfers among the employees.

The application should provide functionality for Customer Support, which is responsible for
collecting data from the customer and creating a Transport Request, which is sent to the Logistics
Department, that gets the required information for determining the suitable Transport Provider.
One of the key requirements of the system is to have functionality for the Customer Support
to change any properties in the Transport Request dynamically and for a Logistics Department to
learn about changes promptly.
